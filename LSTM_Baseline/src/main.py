# 1: pre-process data
testing:
# 2: train LSTM on data
# 3: run LSTM

# need functions for:
#   - train model
#   - run model
#   - save model
#   - prepare data
#   - metrics on how the model is doing

# metrics are defined as follows:
#   - Avg. MAPE individiual forecast
#   - Avg. MAPE Aggregating forecast
#   - Avg. MAPE forecasting the aggregate

# Pre processing:
#   1. isolate subset of used data in Kong et al.   [done]
#   2. Run DBSCAN on the data                       [todo] 
#   3. Encode data for the model                    [todo]

# Model:
#   1. train model                                  [todo]
#   2. load/save model                              [todo]

# Metrics:
#   1. Avg. MAPE individual forecast                [todo]
#   2. Avg. MAPE Aggregating forecast               [todo]
#   3. Avg. MAPE forecasting the aggregate          [todo]
