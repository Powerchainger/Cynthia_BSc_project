# 1: pre-process data
# 2: train LSTM on data
# 3: run LSTM


# need functions for:
#   - train model
#   - run model
#   - save model
#   - prepare data
#   - metrics on how the model is doing

# metrics are defined as follows:
#   - Avg. MAPE individiual forecast
#   - Avg. MAPE Aggregating forecast
#   - Avg. MAPE forecasting the aggregate



# Let's start with preparing the data:
#   - DBSCAN is used for clustering sensible (?) data, need to understand why
